# PROJECT_1-QUADRATIC-EQUATION-ROOTS

This Python program calculates the roots of a quadratic equation of the form `ax^2 + bx + c = 0` using the quadratic formula.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've saved the program files.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the coefficients `a`, `b`, and `c` of the quadratic equation. For example:

6. The program will calculate the roots of the equation and display the results.

7. You will see one of the following outputs:
- Two real roots (e.g., `Root 1: 2.0`, `Root 2: 1.0`)
- One real root (e.g., `Root: 2.0`)
- Complex roots (e.g., `Root 1: 1.0 + 1.0i`, `Root 2: 1.0 - 1.0i`)

8. The program will ask if you want to calculate roots for another equation. You can continue or exit the program.
